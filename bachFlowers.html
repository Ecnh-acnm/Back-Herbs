          <h3>Who Was Edward Bach?</h3>
          <p>Edward Bach, originally pronounced 'Bache', was born in 1886 in Birmingham, England. 
            At the age of 20, he studied medicine and then moved into medical practise and research 
            with the department of bacteriology and immunology. He also studied homoeopathy & became 
            interested in matching the bacteria he was researching with emotional states which lead to his 
            creation of bacterial nosodes. He continued to develop his own thoughts around the effects of the
             mind on physical illness, particularly personality types and how to address these in practice.
              After this, he moved into the use of plants and eventually only flowers as a way of addressing 
            the flaws in personality types that he believed began and worsened the progress of disease.</p>
         <br><br>
          <div class="container reveal">
          <p>Developing his own style of creating remedies, he eventually made the 33 Bach flower remedies used by many today. He died with cancer in 1936, aged 50.</p>

          <h3>Health, disease and healing.</h3>
          <p>Bach wrote a great deal on what he thought about health and disease, and how healing occurred. 
            His writings are freely available online. In synopsis though, he was a vitalist and 
            saw the flower essences as holding subtle vibrational energies, or the vital force, that 
            realigned emotional patterns of dysfunction. When the essences enhanced the personality
             people were born with, to align with their higher self, that realigned emotional patterns
              of dysfunction. When the essences enhanced the personality people were born with, to 
              align with their higher self, they experienced harmony, peace of mind and freely expressed joy. 
            The vital force then was free to help resolve physical disease.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="container reveal">
          <h3>Self-prescription</h3>
          <p>Bach did not want people to detract from the flower essences with complicated theories. He burnt a lot of his theories on how he believed they worked for that reason. To allow people to self-prescribe, he grouped them into common presenting emotional states that you will learn such as fear, uncertainty, and despair. </p>

          <h3>Dosages Instructions</h3>
          <p>As with any essence set that you buy, there is a standard dosage that is suggested. 
            You have instructions of how to make an essence from scratch, however if like many practitioners,
             you prefer to buy the stock kit, you have instructions of how to make an essence from scratch,
              however if like many practitioners, you prefer to buy the stock kit, you can make up a Bach dosage 
              bottle for a client simply by adding two drops of each of the stock remedy strength that you wish
               to use into a 30 ml dropper bottle. Then top up with the flower essence menstruum, such as a 
               combination of spring water and brandy, but you can use any preservative that you would like.
                Once you're done, pop a label on that with instructions for the client of how to use it. 
                You will then instruct the client to take four drops under their tongue a minimum four times per day.
